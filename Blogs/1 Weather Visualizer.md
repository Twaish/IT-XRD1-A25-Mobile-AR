# 1 Weather Visualizer
When entering the weather app, itâ€™s hard to visualize how the different parameters affect the weather. Things such as a wind speed of 15 km/h is difficult to imagine what impact a wind has on the surroundings and the degrees of where the wind is coming from translated to the real world. This app is to make it possible for users to bring these weather conditions into the real world and make it easier to visualize how they affect each other.

## Features
### Weather visualization
Obviously weather visualization. Conditions such as rain, wind, snow, fog and all common weather conditions will be visualized for the user to see, as well as dynamically changing the weather conditions based on other parameters such as transforming rain into snow if the temperature allows for it.

### Time forwarding
The ability to forward time for up to three days, to see the weather condition at that moment. 
Also give the user the ability to change the hours of the day, to visualise changes to the weather that might happen the same day and see how it changes over time.

### Manual weather changer for debugging
The ability to change the weather on command to better test the different weather which is independent from the weather API. Changing the weather to rain or snow (and others), or changing the wind direction and intensity.

### Location selector
The ability to change the city and country to see how the weather from that location affects the users current surroundings, which allows users to compare climates from different parts of the world.
### Weather alerter/forecast
Give the user a basic weather forecast text, providing common weather details like temperature. Alert for severe weather alerts and visualize them.

## Milestones
These milestones will be spread across 3 weeks, each milestone representing what has to be achieved at the end of that week.
### First Milestone
- Simple weather fetching setup
- Visualizers for rain and wind
- Simple UI for changing the day and time of day for weather visualization

### Second Milestone
- Visualizers for clouds, sun and moon cycles/phases, fog, snow and hail
- Wind intensity and direction
- Allow users to change weather visualization location to other cities and countries
- Weather alerts and simulate them (Possibly scale based on interpreted alert severity)
- UI for weather forecast and alerts

### Third Milestone
- Mapping shadows in the environment based on cloud formation
- Visual distortions based on certain parameters
- Season themes
- Visualizers for stars
- Temperature heatmap
- Final UI
